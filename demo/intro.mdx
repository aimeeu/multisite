# Demo Docs

Here's an example document.


Docusaurus 3.2.1 docs

https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/links


Markdown file references only work when the source and target files are processed by the same plugin instance. This is a technical limitation of our Markdown processing architecture and will be fixed in the future. If you are linking files between plugins (e.g. linking to a doc page from a blog post), you have to use URL links.
